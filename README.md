## Project Overview

The Personal Portfolio is a web page designed to showcase my own work and skills. I am adding my own unique touch to the design and layout. With a focus on responsive web design, I utilized HTML and CSS principles to create a visually appealing and functional portfolio.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file that defines the structure of the personal portfolio page.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file responsible for styling the elements on the personal portfolio page.
- `images` - This directory contains various images and logos used in the portfolio.
